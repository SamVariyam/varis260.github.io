	“Aunty, what’s up? Why aren’t you eating the chapati?”
	<br><br>
	“Ah kutti, I won’t eat it. I won’t touch gluten.”
	<br><br>
	“What’s wrong with gluten? I didn’t know you had Celiac.”
	<br><br>
	"Celiac? What is that? No I don’t have any celiac.”
	<br><br>
	<div class="myDIV">“Then what’s wrong with gluten? Did you get this off of Whatsapp, Aunty? I told you Whatsapp isn't a reliable source."</div>
	<div class="hide">Most wheat grown in the U.S. contains Glyphosate, an herbicide that farmers use to dry their wheat out and kill pests residing in their crop. Glyphosate kills and disrupts the bacteria in our gut. The use of glyphosate is outlawed in many other countries.</div>

	<p2 style= "color:purple;">
	“No, ende kutti. Back home, all is fine. But here? Something about U.S. gluten, very bad for me.”
	<br><br>
	<div class="myDIV">“Oh wow, really? Are you sure? Have you asked a doctor?”</div>
	<div class="hide">	Glyphosate also mimics glycine, which is the amino acid in our digestive system that helps us break down gluten. Glyphosate wedges itself into the space that glycine occupies and disrupts the gluten breakdown process.</div>
	<br>
	“Either way, normally I am not eating wheat. Idly, dosa, rice–  none of these have wheat. Why would I bother some doctor with this? I’m fine.”
	<br><br>
	<div class="myDIV">“Hmm. Maybe you’re just not used to it then. But if you never eat wheat how did you find out about your gluten problem?”</div>
	<div class="hide">Gliadin is the gluten subfraction responsible for the allergy to gluten. The concentration of gliadin in wheat is affected by the presence of sulfur. The less sulfur, the more gliadin. States that grow wheat in the U.S. have soil with a significantly less sulfur concentration, meaning that gliadin is found in higher concentrations in wheat grown in the U.S.</div>
	<br>
	“Asheee, I’ll try here and there, no?”
	<br><br>
	<div class="myDIV">“Oh yea, I guess so. But no bread? No chapati? Don’t you miss it? Back home did you ever eat it?”</div>
	<div class="hide">The U.S. also grows a lot of hard red wheat. This is different from other types of wheat found in many other countries, as it has a higher protein content, meaning it contains more gluten.</div>
	<br>
	“Yes of course! Every day for dinner we eat chapati back home. Only here I don’t have.”
	<br><br>
	<div class="myDIV">“Oh because of course, it’s the U.S. gluten that’s the problem, huh.”</div>
	<div class="hide">Gluten intolerance is on the rise worldwide as more people adopt a more Westernized diet that emphasizes bread and other wheat products. U.S. produced wheat is often more genetically modified, is treated with more herbicides and pesticides, and has undergone more processing than wheat from other countries.</div>
	<br>
	“Yes kutta. I’m getting older! These problems come for us once we’ve reached this age. Soon I won’t be here to complain about these things.”
	<br><br>
	<div class="myDIV">“Ahhh, you’re not old aunty! Please, stop spouting everything you hear like it's fact. Just eat your non-glutinous food.”</div>
