	<h1>How to Apply to Medical School</h1>
	<div class="dropdowns">
		<h2 class= "dropdowns"> Get a degree.</h2>
			<div class="vector one"></div>
			<div class="opened">
				<p>Now you can do a pre-med track. Because we make these decisions at the ripe age of 17. Or 16. It’s imperative you decide now whether the next 60 years of your life will be in debt. </p>
				<p>Medical schools actually like to see when you’re not at all interested in medical-related topics. Like Japanese. Major in Japanese, I promise it’s what’s get you into the medical school of your dreams. </p>
			</div>
	</div>
	<div class="dropdowns">
		<h2> Your undergraduate degree gets you on track to take your MCATs. But normally you study seperately for these. Like possibly gap-year long seperately. </h2>
			<div class="vector two"></div>
			<div class="opened">
				<p>Oh yea the MCATs. The single most difficult test ever. Like, ever. </p>
			</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2> On top of the test, complete your application. You can’t just want to go to med school. You need to know why you want to go to med school. What’s your trauma dump?</h2>
		<div class="vector three"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="dropdowns">
		<h2> Oh yea, and don’t forget to actually go to medical school. And get that medical degree.  </h2>
		<div class="vector four"></div>
			<div class="opened"s>
				<p> She’s a girlboss in scrubs? Get outta here. Not that I’ve done it. But I’ve heard it’s doable. </p>
			</div>
	</div>
	<div class="dropdowns">
		<h2> Find a residency program. </h2>
		<div class="vector five"></div>
			<div class="opened">
				<p> Apply to said residency program. Maybe get in? If not, it’s never too late to give up. Even if you do get in, go ahead and give up now. </p>
			</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2> At the end of your residency, take your USMLE test. Second-most hardest test, in case you couldn’t tell. </h2>
		<div class="vector six"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="dropdowns">
		<h2> Obtain your medical license! Hopefully after this you get a job too, of course. </h2>
			<div class="opened">
				<p> P.S. Don’t forget to renew your license. Every two years, in California. Every where else it’s different. </p>
